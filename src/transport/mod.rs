//! Built in transports for quic-rpc
//!
//! There are two sides to a transport, a server side where connections are
//! accepted and a client side where connections are initiated.
//!
//! Connections are bidirectional typed channels, with a distinct type for
//! the send and receive side. They are *unrelated* to services.
//!
//! In the transport module, the message types are referred to as `In` and `Out`.
//!
//! A [`Connector`] can be used to *open* bidirectional typed channels using
//! [`Connector::open`]. A [`Listener`] can be used to *accept* bidirectional
//! typed channels from any of the currently opened connections to clients, using
//! [`Listener::accept`].
//!
//! In both cases, the result is a tuple of a send side and a receive side. These
//! types are defined by implementing the [`StreamTypes`] trait.
//!
//! Errors for both sides are defined by implementing the [`ConnectionErrors`] trait.
